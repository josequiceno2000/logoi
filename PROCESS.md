## Important Considerations
---------------------------
- **Text Cleaning**: The quality of your analysis depends heavily on the cleanliness of the text files. You'll need to handle issues like chapter and verse numbers, headings, and punctuation.
- **Context is Key**: While data analysis can reveal interesting patterns, it's crucial to interpret the results within the historical, cultural, and literary context of the Bible.
- **Translation Variations**: Different translations of the Bible can use different words and phrasing, which might affect your analysis.   

----------
## Process
----------
1. Finds most common word in any given book of the Bible in English
2. Does that for all books of the Bible
3. Displays most common word in each section of the Bible:
    (Old Testament):
        - Pentateuch
        - Historical Books
        - Poetic Books
        - Prophetic Books
    
    (New Testament):
        - Gospels
        - Acts
        - Pauline Epistles
        - Hebrews
        - General Epistles (7 Books from James to Jude)
        - Revalation

4. Repeats steps 1 - 3 for:
    - Latin
    - Greek
    - Hebrew
    - French
    - Italian
    - Spanish

5. Gives translations for those words so that they can be compared to English and vice versa
6. Allow functionality to see multiple language versions of one book or one section of the Bible

-------------------------
## Proximate Improvements
-------------------------
1. ~~Add rest of Bible~~ ✔
    - ~~Work through the program to allow all books to come in~~ ✔
    - ~~Rework sections~~ ✔
2. ~~Allow user to enter custom words to exclude~~ ✔
3. ~~Combine "come" and "came" in analysis~~ ✔
4. ~~Remove "said" from analysis~~ ✔
5. ~~Improve Markdown of this README file~~ ✔
6. ~~Make the bible_sections a dictionary of lists~~ ✔
7. ~~Get data from each section of the Bible as defined in bible_sections~~ ✔
8. ~~Make functions separate from main.py (especially getting input from user on stop_words)~~ ✔
9. Allow user to search a word and see its frequency in different books and sections
10. Use data visualization to portray word counts
11. Find a way to have biblical data scrapped 
12. Store biblical data analyses in a smart database for later study

## Possible Future Extensions
-----------------------------
### Word and Phrase Analysis
- *Word Frequency Analysis*: Determine the most frequent words in each book, across the entire Bible, or within specific sections (e.g., Old Testament vs. New Testament). This can reveal key themes and vocabulary.   
- *Collocation Analysis*: Identify words that frequently appear together. This can highlight important relationships between concepts and recurring phrases.
- *N-gram Analysis*: Explore sequences of words (bigrams, trigrams, etc.) to find common phrases and patterns in the text.   
- *Keyword Extraction*: Use algorithms to identify the most important words and phrases in each book, providing a summary of its content.   
- *Sentiment Analysis*: Analyze the emotional tone of different books or passages. Are certain books more positive or negative in their language?   
- *Lexical Diversity*: Measure the richness of vocabulary used in different books. Are some authors or sections using a wider range of words?

### Thematic Analysis
- *Topic Modeling*: Use techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover underlying themes and topics within the Bible. This can help identify recurring ideas that might not be immediately obvious.   
- *Comparative Analysis*: Compare the use of specific words or themes across different books or sections. For example, how does the concept of "love" differ between the Gospels and the Epistles?
- *Character Analysis*: If you can identify mentions of specific characters, you can analyze the context in which they appear and the words associated with them.
- *Geographic Analysis*: Identify mentions of locations and analyze their frequency and context.

### Stylistic Analysis
- *Sentence Length Distribution*: Analyze the length of sentences in different books. Some books might have longer, more complex sentences, while others are more concise.
- *Word Length Distribution*: Examine the length of words used. This could indicate differences in writing style or the complexity of the subject matter.
- *Repetition Analysis*: Identify patterns of repeated words or phrases, which can be significant for emphasis or literary effect.


### Network Analysis
- *Word Co-occurrence Networks*: Build networks where nodes are words and edges represent how often they appear together. This can visualize the relationships between concepts.
- *Character Interaction Networks*: If you can identify character mentions and their interactions, you can build networks to visualize relationships between biblical figures.

### Historical and Linguistic Insights
- *Evolution of Language*: If you have access to different translations or older versions, you could analyze changes in language and word usage over time.
- *Identifying Influences*: Compare the vocabulary and themes to other contemporary texts to explore potential influences.

-----------------------
## Tools and Techniques
-----------------------

*To perform these analyses, you would typically use programming languages like Python with libraries such as:*

- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For text preprocessing, tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and more.
- spaCy: Another powerful library for advanced NLP tasks.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks like topic modeling and sentiment analysis.   
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.   

-------------------------
## Practical Applications
-------------------------
- **Bible Study Tools**: Develop tools that help users explore the Bible in new ways, such as finding verses related to specific themes or visualizing word relationships.
- **Theological Research**: Provide data-driven insights for theological study and interpretation.
- **Educational Resources**: Create interactive learning materials based on the Bible text.
