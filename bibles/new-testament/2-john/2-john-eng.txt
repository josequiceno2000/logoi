The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not only I, but also all who know the truth, -- 2 john 1:1
.
for the sake of the truth which abides in us and will be with us forever: -- 2 john 1:2
.
Grace, mercy and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. -- 2 john 1:3
.
I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth, just as we have received commandment to do from the Father. -- 2 john 1:4
.
Now I ask you, lady, not as though I were writing to you a new commandment, but the one which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another. -- 2 john 1:5
.
And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it. -- 2 john 1:6
.
For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the antichrist. -- 2 john 1:7
.
Watch yourselves, that you do not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may receive a full reward. -- 2 john 1:8
.
Anyone who goes too far and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God; the one who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son. -- 2 john 1:9
.
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not give him a greeting; -- 2 john 1:10
.
for the one who gives him a greeting participates in his evil deeds. -- 2 john 1:11
.
Though I have many things to write to you, I do not want to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that your joy may be made full. -- 2 john 1:12
.
The children of your chosen sister greet you. -- 2 john 1:13
