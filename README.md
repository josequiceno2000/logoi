## Motivation
I wanted a tool that would help me engage with the Bible comprehensively. More than that, I wanted a tool that could make sense of all the words in the Word, something that would tell a story through them.

Logoi is greek for "words". But it can also mean "reasons" or "senses". It is a tool that, with continuing development, will allow me and anyone else to see into Scripture more clearly through modern natural language processing techniques. My hope is that this will help future biblical scholars and lovers of the Word with their dutiful study.

### Major Analyses (Current and Upcoming):
1. Word Frequency Analysis:
    - Determine the most frequent words in each book, across the entire Bible, or within specific sections (e.g., Old Testament vs. New Testament). 
    - *Can reveal key themes and vocabulary.*
2. *Collocation Analysis*: 
    - Identify words that frequently appear together. 
    - Highlights important relationships between concepts and recurring phrases.
3. *N-gram Analysis*: 
    - Explore sequences of words (bigrams, trigrams, etc.) to find common phrases and patterns in the text.   
4. *Keyword Extraction*: 
    - Use algorithms to identify the most important words and phrases. 
    - Helpful for summarizing content.   
5. *Sentiment Analysis*: 
    - Analyze emotional tone across different books or passages. 
    - Are certain books more positive or negative in their language?   
6. *Lexical Diversity*: 
    - Measure the richness of vocabulary used in different books. 
    - Are some authors or sections using a wider range of words? Which authors share vocabulary?
